Delete old files

Config Folder: BepinEx/config/Seasonality

You can now specify which root folder the plugin reads, meaning you can have profiles.

This way, I do not need to have a seperate texture pack mod, you can install another texture pack and simply add it to the Config Folder, give its unique folder name, and change the configurations to target that specific folder.

Built-in SeasonalTweaks, toggleable configs, YML files found in Seasonality folder.
```

If you are experiencing issues with textures looking weird, it is perhaps due to other mods interacting with shaders.

Known mods causing this issue: VALKEA, MonsterLabz
